		Lebowski ipsum there's no fucking reason—here's my point, Dude—there's no fucking reason. Brandt can't watch though. Or he has to pay a hundred. I'm not Mr. Lebowski; you're Mr. Lebowski. I'm the Dude. Show me what you got. Nihilist. Dipshit with a nine-toed woman. I just want to say, sir, that we're both enormous—on a personal level. That's fuckin' combat. The man in the black pyjamas, Dude. Worthy fuckin' adversary.

		I'm saying, Cynthia's Pomeranian. I'm looking after it while Cynthia and Marty Ackerman are in Hawaii. She's gotta feed the monkey, I mean —hasn't that ever occurred to you, Sir? Jesus, man, can you change the station? VEE FUCK YOU UP, MAN! VEE TAKE YOUR MONEY! Excuse me! Mark it zero. Next frame. What the fuck does Vietnam have to do with anything! What the fuck were you talking about?!
