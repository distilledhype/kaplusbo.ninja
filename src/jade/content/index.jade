		One part of Ka+Bo lives in Bad Cannstatt, which is part of the city Stuttgart. Bad is actually the German word for bath.
		If a city has Bad in front of its name in Germany it means that there are natural mineral water springs in this
		place and you'll have the opportunity to visit mineral baths there. 
		
		Bad also is an English word for evil or "not good". In the Jamaican Patois dialect bad can often stand for the 
		opposite of its original meaning. When somebody says "this song ya bad" it means that the person really likes the 
		song. 
		
		This most likely stems from the fact that the word "bad" is connected to the word Badman which could be translated
		with the word "Gangsta" and much like "Gangsta", "Badman" stands for the ultimate cool and absolute dominance.
		
		So you could say calling something bad, is like saying that something dominates. 
		
		We turned around the words in the name "Bad Cannstatt" to make use the word "bad" in the Jamaican Patois way,
		basically saying that Bad Cannstatt rulez.
		
		We are topping that statement by mixing up these two meanings in the segment where Kahlil says "we no regular bad,
		we mineral bad, bwoy test dem get a funeral bath". Basically saying that we are not merely the regular kind of 
		ultimate cool but the mineral version of it, making mineral a word that qualifies the following word
		as somethings better than it is by itself. This makes absolutely no sense but it makes us chuckle.
		
		Here are the complete lyrics (written in plain English but performed in Jamaican Patois):

			I can feel the crowd pulse through my veins  
			Tell myself to simmer down ready for the unveil  
			Me and my family we run the town  
			Guess who wears the crown  
			Guess who makes the deepest sound  
			Just so deep that you could drown  
			
			(Badd) We don't play  
			Put in the work more than all day  
			People say we are flyer than Nike Air  
			When we do something we do it with care  
			
			Cannstatt Badd
			
			(Repeat)
			
			We are not regular badd  
			We are mineral badd  
			Boy test, they get funeral bath
